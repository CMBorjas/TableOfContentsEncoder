A clockwork orange peeling itself in reverse
A fish riding a bicycle through a nebula
Melting clocks draped over a weeping willow
A sentient cloud of blue smoke arguing with a streetlamp
A toaster that only toasts bread on the prime number seconds
A library where the books are made of glass and the words are fish
A giraffe wearing a tuxedo made of mirrors
A piano that plays colors instead of sounds
A staircase that leads to yesterday
A cup of coffee that tastes like the number 7
